AYCL: A personal project aimed to familiarize myself with machine learning tools (sklearn, Tensorflow/Keras) and techniques pertaining to image classification. Mainly worked with the MNIST digits dataset. Culminated into an implementation of a deep B-VAE trained on anime face datasets from Kaggle.    

GANs: Deep dive into GANs. Try to generate cats.
